## About me

My name is Johan Sörell and I am a Senior System Administrator that loves everything about Automation, Opensource, Linux, CI/CD.
I started my career back in the 90's building computers at a computer shop at the same time as I was studying towards MCSE NT 4,

I moved to Dublin, Ireland  1999 and worked for Comapaq as a Support Represenative, I stayed in Ireland for 1,1/2 Years. 
Then I moved to London and worked as a Linguistic Engineer for a year. The Last 20 Years I have been working with a lot of diffrent things,
both as an emplyee, consultant and even had my own buissness. I have worked as Helpdesk manager, infrastructure engineer, PHP programmer,
Automation Engineer. Taken care of multiple sites in many contries, building infrastructure and automating tasks.

Between 2005 and 2008 I had my own Internet radio station.

In this blog I will have HowTo's, tips and trix, do's and dont's. I will take request's from people that want to get something explained.  

If you like the aritcles I write then please donate so I can keep this blog up and running.
