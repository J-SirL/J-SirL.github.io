This includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc. Terraform can manage both existing service providers and custom in-house solutions. Key Features of TerraformInfrastructure as CodeYou describe your infrastructure using Terraform’s high-level configuration language in human-readable, declarative configuration files. This allows you to create a blueprint that you can version, share, and reuse. Execution PlansTerraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do and asks for your approval before making any infrastructure changes. This allows you to review changes before Terraform creates, updates, or destroys infrastructure. Resource GraphTerraform builds a resource graph and creates or modifies non-dependent resources in parallel. This allows Terraform to build resources as efficiently as possible and gives you greater insight into your infrastructure. Change AutomationTerraform can apply complex changesets to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. When you update configuration files, Terraform determines what changed and creates incremental execution plans that respect dependencies.Getting StartedClone projectgit clone https://github.com/J-SirL/install_terraform.gitChange to project foldercd install_terraform/PlayBooksInventoryEither create a [terraform] group in the inventory or change hosts to all in playbook[terraform]# use fqdn or the ip address of the system where you want to install terraformterraformclient.example.com Run it with ansible-playbookansible-playbook install_or_update_terraform.ymlAlternatively run it with a speciffic inventory fileansible-playbook -i inventory install_or_update_terraform.yml" }, { "title": "add user and create ssh folder and add ssh key to authorized_keys centos", "url": "/2017/04/24/add-user-and-create-ssh-folder-and-add-ssh-key-to-authorized_keys-centos/", "categories": "CentOS, Linux", "tags": "authorized_keys, CentOS, Linux, RHEL, ssh, ssh keys", "date": "2017-04-24 21:02:17 +0000", "snippet": "First we need to create the user before we create the ssh folder and the file authorized_keysStep one user creationAdd user:sudo useradd theusernameadd user to the wheel group  ( -a = append G is group wheel is the group to add the user to! )sudo usermod -aG wheel theusernameSet password for user theusernamesudo passwd theusernameTest the sudo for the user theusernamesudo ls -la /rootStep two create the .ssh folder and authorized_keys and set permissionscreate .ssh foldermkdir ~/.sshcretate the file authorized_keystouch authorized_keyschange permissions on ssh folderchmod 700 ~/.sshchange permission on file authorized_keyschmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keysrestore SELinux settings on ~/.sshrestorecon -Rv ~/.sshStep three copy the ssh_key to serveropen ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and add your public keyvi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys" }, { "title": "Install Docker-machine on Linux", "url": "/2017/03/21/install-docker-machine-on-linux/", "categories": "Docker, IT automation, Linux", "tags": "", "date": "2017-03-21 00:18:00 +0000", "snippet": "Install Docker-machine on Linuxfirst check latest release of Docker Machine here:https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/latest/Replace v0.10.0 with the latest docker-machine version if it has a newer version when you read this.curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.10.0/docker-machine-`uname -s`-`uname -m` &amp;gt;/tmp/docker-machine &amp;amp;&amp;amp; chmod +x /tmp/docker-machine &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo cp /tmp/docker-machine /usr/local/bin/docker-machineNext I will tell you how to use docker-machine with virtualbox" }, { "title": "Setting up a cisco router/switch securely", "url": "/2015/11/25/setting-up-a-cisco-routerswitch-securely/", "categories": "Cisco, Network", "tags": "", "date": "2015-11-25 19:49:49 +0000", "snippet": "Router&amp;gt;Router&amp;gt;EnableRouter#config tRouter(config)#hostname Router1-1Router1-1(config)#enable password mePassWordRouter1-1(config)#enable secret MeSecretPasswordRouter1-1(config)#service password-encryptionRouter1-1(config)#username meUser Privilege 15 password 0 MeNewPasswordformeUserRouter1-1(config)#banner motd # Welcome to Router1-1 #Router1-1(config)#banner login $ You have to be authorized to use this device or get the heck out $Router1-1(config)#ip domain-lookupRouter1-1(config)#ip domain-name sitedevelopments.netRouter1-1(config)#ip name-server 192.168.1.12Router1-1(config)#crypto key generate rsa The name of this key will be: Router1-1.sitedevelopments.net Choose the size of the key modulus in the range of 360 to 2048 for your General Purpose Keys.

This first blogpost is just a rewrite of the manual page for firewalld. This post is the first of many parts how many I’ll write depends on how many people who wants this information. If I see that it’s popular I will write a lot about it. In this blog post I have written the command for you to grab the right manual page like this: man firewalld when you see a command like this [ man page number page ]  for example:  man 5 firewalld.zone  it’s opens up page 5 of the command. sometimes you just can write [man page] for example: man firewalld.zone instead but I usually type the page number to make sure I am in the right spot it’s just a habit of mine often you do not have to type the page number.Manual page: firewalld – Dynamic Firewall ManagerOPTIONSThese are the command line options of firewalld:-h –help | “Prints a short help text and exists.”Example: firewalld -h–debug[=level]Set the debug level for firewalld to level. The range of the debug level is 1 (lowest level) to 10 (highest level). The debug output will be written to the firewalld log file /var/log/firewalld.Example: firewalld –debug[=5]–debug-gcPrint garbage collector leak information. The collector runs every 10 seconds and if there are leaks, it prints information about the leaks.Example: firewalld –debug-gc–noforkTurn off daemon forking. Force firewalld to run as a foreground process instead of as a daemon in the background.Example: firewalld –nofork–nopidDisable writing pid file. By default the program will write a pid file. If the program is invoked with this option it will not check for an existing server process.Example: firewalld –nopidDESCRIPTIONfirewalld provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for network/firewall zones to define the trust level of network connections or interfaces. It has support for IPv4, IPv6 firewallsettings and for ethernet bridges and has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration options. It also supports an interface for services or applications to add firewall rules directly.CONCEPTSfirewalld has a D-BUS interface for firewall configuration of services and applications. It also has a command line client for the user. Services or applications already using D-BUS can requestchanges to the firewall with the D-BUS interface directly. For more information on the firewalld D-BUS interface, please have a look at manual page 5 of firewalld.dbus.man 5 firewalld.dbusfirewalld provides support for zones, predefined services and ICMP types and has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration options. Permanent configuration is loaded from XML files in/usr/lib/firewalld or /etc/firewalld (see the section called “DIRECTORIES”).If NetworkManager is not used, there are some limitations: firewalld will not get notified about network device renames. If firewalld gets started after the network is already up, the connectionsare not bound to a zone. Manually created interfaces are not bound to a zone. Please add them to a zone with **firewall-cmd –zone=zone –add-interface=interface.**Example: firewall-cmd –zone=public –add-interface=wlp3s0ZonesA network or firewall zone defines the trust level of the interface used for a connection. There are several pre-defined zones provided by firewalld. Zone configuration options and genericinformation about zones are described in man 5 firewalld.zoneServicesA service can be a list of local ports and destinations and additionally also a list of firewall helper modules automatically loaded if a service is enabled. Service configuration options andgeneric information about services are described in man 5 firewalld.service . The use of predefined services makes it easier for the user to enable and disable access to a service.ICMP typesThe Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to exchange information and also error messages in the Internet Protocol (IP). ICMP types can be used in firewalld to limit the exchange of thesemessages. For more information, please have a look at man firewalld.icmptype .Runtime configurationRuntime configuration is the actual active configuration and is not permanent. After reload/restart of the service or a system reboot, runtime settings will be gone if they haven’t been also inpermanent configuration.Permanent configurationThe permanent configuration is stored in config files and will be loaded and become new runtime configuration with every machine boot or service reload/restart.Direct interfaceThe direct interface is mainly used by services or applications to add specific firewall rules. The rules are not permanent and need to get applied after receiving the start, restart or reloadmessage from firewalld using D-BUS.DIRECTORIESfirewalld supports two configuration directories:Default/Fallback configuration in: /usr/lib/firewalldThis directory contains the default and fallback configuration provided by firewalld for icmptypes, services and zones. The files provided with the firewalld package should not get changed and thechanges are gone with an update of the firewalld package. Additional icmptypes, services and zones can be provided with packages or by creating files.System configuration settings in: /etc/firewalldThe system or user configuration stored here is either created by the system administrator or by customization with the configuration interface of firewalld or by hand.

GlusterFS clusters together storage building blocks over Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect, aggregating disk and memory resources and managing data in a single global namespace. GlusterFS is based on a stackable user space design and can deliver exceptional performance for diverse workloads. Figure 1. GlusterFS – One Common Mount Point GlusterFS supports standard clients running standard applications over any standard IP network. Figure 1, above, illustrates how users can access application data and files in a Global namespace using a variety of standard protocols. No longer are users locked into costly, monolithic, legacy storage platforms. GlusterFS gives users the ability to deploy scale-out, virtualized storage – scaling from terabytes to petabytes in a centrally managed and commoditized pool of storage.

Thisis usually a symbolic link to /usr/X11R6/include/X11./usr/include/asmInclude files which declare some assembler functions. This used to be a symbolic link to /usr/src/linux/include/asm./usr/include/linuxThis contains information which may change from system releaseto system release and used to be a symbolic link to/usr/src/linux/include/linux to get at operating system specificinformation. (Note that one should have include files there that work cor-rectly with the current libc and in user space. However, Linuxkernel source is not designed to be used with user programs anddoes not know anything about the libc you are using. It is verylikely that things will break if you let /usr/include/asm and/usr/include/linux point at a random kernel tree.

The recommendations is cut and pasted directly from RedHat’s recommendations.This time I will give you a simple table of swap recommendations that you should follow if you are setting up a system with RedHat Enterprise 6.x / CentOS 6.x and Fedora 6.x Amount of RAM in the system Recommended swap space Recommended swap space if allowing for hibernation ⩽&amp;nbsp;2GB 2 times the amount of RAM 3 times the amount of RAM &amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;2GB – 8GB Equal to the amount of RAM 2 times the amount of RAM &amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;8GB – 64GB 0.5 times the amount of RAM 1.5 times the amount of RAM &amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;64GB 4GB of swap space No extra space needed At the border between each range listed above (for example, a system with 2GB, 8GB, or 64GB of system RAM), discretion can be exercised with regard to chosen swap space and hibernation support. If your system resources allow for it, increasing the swap space may lead to better performance. Note that distributing swap space over multiple storage devices — particularly on systems with fast drives, controllers and interfaces — also improves swap space performance. Note Swap space size recommendations issued for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2 differed from the current recommendations, which were first issued with the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 in June 2012 and did not account for hibernation space. Automatic installations of these earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 still generate a swap space in line with these superseded recommendations. However, manually selecting a swap space size in line with the newer recommendations issued for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 is advisable for optimal performance.

To squelch this message and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use: git config &amp;#8211;global push.default matching To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use: git config &amp;#8211;global push.default simple See &amp;#8216;git help config&amp;#8217; and search for &amp;#8216;push.default&amp;#8217; for further information.

Use the similar mode &amp;#8216;current&amp;#8217; instead of &amp;#8216;simple&amp;#8217; if you sometimes use older versions of Git) The stackoverflow user: hammar describes it very well below: It&amp;#8217;s explained in great detail in the docs (search for push.default on the page), but I&amp;#8217;ll try to summarize: matching means git push will push all your local branches to the ones with the same name on the remote. This makes it easy to accidentally push a branch you didn&amp;#8217;t intend to. simple means git push will push only the current branch to the one that git pull would pull from, and also checks that their names match. This is a more intuitive behavior, which is why the default is getting changed to this. This setting only affects the behavior of your local client, and can be overridden by explicitly specifying which branches you want to push on the command line.
